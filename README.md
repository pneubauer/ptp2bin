The `ptp2bin` script converts an ITS CROSS assembler PTP file to an Apple II disk image.  

This script exists to run MIT Logo for the Apple II originally developed on ITS at MIT.
See the [PDP-10 ITS repository](https://github.com/PDP-10/its/tree/master/doc/aplogo) for details
on MIT Logo and [source code](https://github.com/PDP-10/its/tree/master/src/aplogo).
